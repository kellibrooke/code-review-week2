# Code Review - "Track Suggester" - Week 2 - Intro To Programming - Epicodus - Portland, OR

#### _This is a final project for the second week of the Intro to Programming course at Epicodus in Portland, May 28 - June 1, 2018_

#### By _**Kelli McCloskey**_

## Description

_The instructions for this project are as follows:_

#### Create a Track Suggester webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) that asks future Epicodus students a series of questions about themselves and provides a track suggestion based on their answers (Ruby/Rails, CSS/React, or C#/.NET). You can ask questions about the languages themselves, the kinds of environments where these languages are used, or anything else you find relevant.

* Include a minimum of 5 survey questions.
* Offer 3 different track suggestions
* Don't forget regular Git commits and a detailed README. Commit messages should always be on-topic and professional in tone.

#### If you finish the objectives with time to spare, consider adding additional features such as:

* Ask the user for their name and address them directly in all of the responses to them: "Enrique, you ought to study Java, so you can learn how to make mobile apps for Android!".
* Make questions multiple choice (like a, b, or c); determine which track is right for a user by identifying the letter that was most frequently selected; for example, "You chose mostly a's, you should definitely study C#!".
* Use fade in/out or slide in/out jQuery Effects throughout your project.
* Other enhancements such as more custom CSS, animation, or modals as you desire.
